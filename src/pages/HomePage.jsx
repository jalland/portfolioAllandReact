        My name is Josh Alland. I am a scientist and full-stack web developer. On the science side, I am an Associate Scientist at NOAA's National Hurricane Center (NHC). At NHC, I work on the Hurricane Specialist Unit (HSU) team, where I help forecasters analyze and interpret data from satellites, aircraft, and other sources to improve the accuracy of hurricane forecasts. I also help maintain and improve the HSU's internal and external web-based tools and databases. On the web development side, I am a graduate of the University of Miami's Coding Bootcamp. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Express, MySQL, MongoDB, React, and other web development technologies.
